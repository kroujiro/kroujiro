## Hi there 👋

<!--
**kroujiro/kroujiro** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on absoutely nothing! I should be finishing my studies, but instead am wasting my life (´・ω・`)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programing (python with my buddy), game making
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, hate working in teams
- 💬 Ask me about whatever idc
- 📫 How to reach me: krolow@keemail.me or @tyttorn on X. The email is more assured, I may end up deleting twitter, I hate social medias
- ⚡ Fun fact: you can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick
