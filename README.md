## Hello (ã€ƒï¿£Ï‰ï¿£ã€ƒ)ã‚ž

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on absoutely nothing (and my Rance "fangame" check ranco_br)! I should be finishing my studies, but instead am wasting my life (Â´ãƒ»Ï‰ãƒ»`)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programing (python with my buddy), game making
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing, hate working in teams
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever idc
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: krolow@keemail.me or @tyttorn on X. The email is more assured, I may end up deleting twitter, I hate social medias
- âš¡ Fun fact: you can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick
